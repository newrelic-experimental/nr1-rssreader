## About this Nerdpack

>This nerdpack is an rss reader that displays each stream on its own card.  When you add a stream, you can add a logo for the site if you wish.   The initial intention of this application was for displaying status from SAAS 
companies like AWS , AZURE.., PagerDuty, etc.   However, it is not limited to that, it can be used for any RSS source, like news or weather.

## Open source license

## Requirements

This application requires a proxy server to fetch the rss streams through, in order to avoid CORS errors.  By defualt,  it is using a free proxy https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/,
but you can use any you wish.  Currently,  the proxy is hard coded in statuscard.js file.

(If you have them installed, these commands return a version number; if not, the commands aren't recognized.)
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
